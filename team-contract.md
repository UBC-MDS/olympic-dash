# Project Teamwork Contract - Group 22 UBC MDS 2021-22
## Course Name: DSCI532 Visualization II
### Student names: 
Andy Yang, Helin Wang, Rubén De la Garza Macías, Allyson Stoll

### Team project topic:
We aim to build a dashboard to support either a member of the IOC who is investigating abnormal performance trends of certain countries or which countries are potential future contenders, or curious olympics fans who want to explore the dataset to see success trends of different countries. 

### Communications:
For effective teamwork to occur there needs to be a free, open and professional expression of ideas and feelings at all times. Each team member takes responsibility to communicate their ideas, thoughts and concerns. Respectful communication outside of the meetings will be through Slack or Github. Github will be the primary communication tool for ideas, suggestions, submitting work and reviewing work. Slack will be the primary communication tool for informal communication and scheduling meetings. 

### Expectations:
The expected time spent on the project is to meet as a group 6-8 hours per week, and individual work will be managed by each member to meet the deadline as discussed by the group. We are targeting to submit each milestone by end of day Friday (10pm) each week, and will not leave the submission until the last minutes on Saturday. All group members are expected to meet the submission rubric and project requirement. The coding should have no syntax errors and the written analysis should be in proper English. 
All members are expected to spend time discussing major changes together during group meetings and only submit a pull request for key issues that are not captured before on the repository for the group project on Github.com. Repository issues should be reviewed and acknowledged within half a business day after creation. Slack response turnaround should be within 2 hours between 9am and 9pm. 

### Meeting commitments:
Preferably group meetings will be held in-person during the weekly lab session, but can be held on the Slack group channel if someone can’t attend in person. Prior to each group meeting we should finish reading all the milestone outline and summary.  Meetings are held on the following dates:
+ Every Monday at lab time (2-3:50 pm);
+ Schedule additional meetings through Slack if needed. 

If you cannot attend the meetings, 24 hour notice is required, except in case of an emergency.

### Breach of Contract:
Failure to follow the team contract will result in a three-step warning system:
1. The first step is a written Slack notice that outlines the violation of the team contract and a reminder of the team contract conditions.
2. The second step is to meet and write an agreement that the behavriou should be changed as instructed in the team contract.
3. The third step is to reach out to the lab instructor or TAs of the issues with the teammate.

#### Examples of contract breach:
+ No response to slack channel communication within 12 hours as agreed by the team.
+ No response to pull request in the github within 24 hours as agreed by the team.
+ Not able to complete individual tasks by the deadline agreed on and subsequently cause a late submission to our group project.
