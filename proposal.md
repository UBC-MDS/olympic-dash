## Reseach Question and Usage Scenario

Some of the research questions that our app will answer are the following:

- Which countries have been improving their performance in the olympics historically?
- Have countries performed better in the summer or winter olympics?
- What are some common characteristics among the athletes that compete in the same event?
- Which athletes have won the most medals across the years?

Here's also a description of the user persona:

Harry is a member of the IOC (International Olympic Committee). He and his team have been working recently on investigating if there are any abnormal performance trends for certain countries. They want to know if there is something that they can do to help countries that have been perfoming worse every olympic cycle with the techniques that high performing countries are using to generate more competitive events in the olympics. They also want to know which are countries are on the rise, to become future contenders in most events, so that they can reward them by hosting the olympics on their countries if feasible and encourage athlete development around the world in this way.
