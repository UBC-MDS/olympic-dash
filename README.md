# olympic-dash

An interactive dashboard illustrating historic olympic data and trends

## Description

This app contains a dashboard which visualizes Olympic data from 1896 up until 2016. 
Key metrics of interest will be displayed including: 
- Medals earned per country
- Medals earned depending on athlete age
- Athlete height based on Olympic events 
- Medals per country will be displayed 

Medals earned per country will be displayed via a bubble chart accompanied by a 
slider, allowing users to control the year of the Olympics displayed by the graph. 

A bar chart will show the medals earned for each athlete age bracket, while a histogram 
will show the distribution of athlete heights based on the event selected. These figures 
will contain a slider allowing users to adjust athlete age ranges and a dropdown list, 
allowing users to select the event visualized respectively. 

Lastly, a line graph will display the number of medals earned by countries over time. This 
figure will be accompanied by a dropdown list allowing users to select a subset of countries 
to display on the graph. 

A general slider included on the side of the dashboard will allow for filtering of 
summer/winter Olympics data, while radio buttons will allow for users to filter data 
by the type of medals displayed. Using these filters, users can investigate trends 
in Olympic success between countries as well as athlete demographics.
